# Swish Swoosh

## Swashbuckling rules faster than a duel to the death or a doomed romance

### Purpose of These Rules

The purpose of this ruleset is to enable fast-paced storytelling with player agency while still leaving room for randomness and exciting reversals in fortune.

### Basic Rules

All dice are ten-sided (d10). Each die that is equal to or more than the treshold number (TN) is considered a success. Typically the TN for all rolls is 8, but more on that later.

Each die that shows a 10 explodes. It is counted as a success and a new die is rolled. The GM's dice do not explode. The PCs are the heroes after all.

Optional rule: if the player (again, not the GM) rolls more ones than half the number of dice rolled, the roll is automatically treated as a catastrophic failure. This might become tedious to track and might not fit the situation, so use it only to spice the game up if needed.

Each PC has between three to five abilities. These abilities have values between 2 and 6 (more on those later). When the character does something that involves danger or interesting consequences on failure, the player rolls the amount of dice designated by a suitable ability. Any amount of successess is a general success and extra ones can be used to add flare to the action (such as succeeding faster, quiter or while blowing a kiss to the handsome villain). No successess is a failure.

Sometimes the players (and the GM) want to roll on things, but they feel that the situation isn't your standard situation. The following table gives examples of different modifiers that can be used. But remember, the characters are Heroes with a capital H. They should be able to be proficient in things they've never even heard of.

|The character ability seems off for the situation|-1 die|
|The character ability is clearly completely wrong for the situation|-2 dice|
|The character is well prepared or the situation is easy for a Hero|+1 die|
|The players want to roll on a task that is so easy it shouldn't be rolled on|+2 dice|
|The situation is extra difficult for a Hero|+1 to TN|
|The situation is extremely easy for a Hero|-1 to TN|

Multiple modifiers can of course stack, but the player never rolls less than 1 die or the TN never goes above 9.

If another character (PC or NPC) helps the character, give them +1 die of assistance (if a PC assist, they can roll their assistance die and describe the help they give). If a PC is helping in a task that fits their abilities, have the amount of dice be their ability divided by 2 (and rounded up) instead.

### Fate and Panache

Each character has two scores called Fate and Panache. These are the traditional metacurrencies of RPGS. Both start at their maximum at the start of an adventure.

Fate is used to power strong abilities. Also after seeing their result from a dice roll, the player may choose to use a Fate point to reroll any (even all) of their dice.

Panache is the coolness and composure of the character much like the traditional hit points. Panache is damaged as a consequence of failed rolls or in extended sequences. Once a player character is brought down to 0 panache, they are on the cusp of defeat. The next panache they have to pay, usually as damage from an attack, they will leave the scene in a way that is suitable. This could mean fainting, being badly wounded or even just running away.

After a scene is over, all defeated PCs return and have their panache set to 0. After suitable rest and refreshements have been had, the GM may let the players get some panache back. For example, if the PCs spend a week recovering at a friendly monastery, giving them back all of their panache seems fair.

### Extended Sequences and Combat

Heroes have a tendency to get into situations that would call for a lengthened sequence such as combat, a chase or even tense negotiations. An extended sequence breaks the game into rounds during which each PC gets to act.

First, the GM describes the situation and what happens if the PCs do nothing. There are three kinds of blocks the GM can build the round from:

- **Danger**: A Danger is something that will hurt the PCs if they do not react to it. It could be a raging fire or a group of henchmen. A Danger has a damage value that, if not handled, one or more PCs will have to take as damage to their panache at the end of the round. A Danger might have a Panache track if the threat can be defeated.

- **Villain**: The big bad of the sequence. A Villain has to be an active participant in the story, usually a major NPC. They are much like a Danger, but far more volatile. They have a dicepool and a Panache track.

- **Obstacle**: An Obstacle is something that will happen at the end of the round, but won't cause damage to the PCs directly. Examples include a lady falling to her death from the roof or the villain managing to catch up to the escaping carriage the PCs are in.

**GM advice**: Usually a round should include a combination of blocks equal to the amount of players minus one. If the the sequence is a climactic battle or another highlight, they GM may up this so that there are blocks equal to the player amount. Or if the situation is hopeless (for example, the players messed up earlier but still wanted to enter a battle), there might even be blocks one more than the player count.

If a Danger or a Villain is not engaged or not enough successes are gathered, the surplus is taken by the players as damage to their Panache. Usually, if the damage is aimed at one character and generic, the GM should let the players distribute the damage as they want within limits of the story. A group of henchmen will punch the players equally or two heroes fighting a villain might both take hits from them, but a snipershot rarely hits multiple heroes.

On the flipside, if the players generate a surplus of successes, they can do damage to Dangers or Villains if those have a Panache track. In the case of Obstacles or Dangers without a Panache track, they GM should let them players receive some advantage for their extra successes or even transfer them as damage to a Danger.

Next, the players decide what they will do during the round and in which order. A player action consists of a move (when in combat) and an action. An action should always result in engaging with any of the building block of the scene, but it can be just aid to another character acting afterwards.

The special case to this is when a player engages a Villain for the first time in the round. Then, and only then, the GM rolls the dice for the Villain as if it were a PC (but the enemy dice don't fumble or explode). This will be the Villain's Damage Value for this round. 

**GM advice**: Usually a Villain should have a dicepool of roughly the same as the best PC ability, but the GM can tune this up or down.

In the case of combat, the battlefield is divided into suitable zones. For example, a ship's deck might have two zones that represent the stern and the bow areas. A move action can be used to go to an adjacent areas although sometimes an ability roll is required (climbing a rope). A character does not need to move to engage with a block in their zone.

**Optional rule**: The first player acting should get +1D to their ability roll if they can tell how they use the environment or consequences of the previous round to aid in their roll. This should be a different player from round to round.

**Optional rule**: A player should alternate between the abilities that they have to make the narrative more dynamic. If the PC uses the same ability multiple rounds in a row, they should get a cumulative -1D for each round they've used the ability in a row. 

Once each PC has acted, deal any damage to Panache (both PC and NPC), resolve Obstacles and determine if another round is needed. The GM then continues describing how the situation changed.

**GM advice**: Each round should be unique. Never spend more than two rounds without something changing. Maybe the battlefield changes, the Villain tries to escape instead of defeating the players or even reinforcements can be heard joining the fight in a future round.

### Character Creation

A player character consists of abilities, Fate, Panache and specialities.

To create your abilities, think of three or four descriptions of your character, such as "brash duelist" or "world-famous seductress". The description could even be the motto of the character (like "It's clobberin' time").

Mark the most important ability as a 5 and the next as 4. The rest are 3s. This is how many dice you will roll when this ability is being used. Remember that a PC always rolls at least 1 die, even if it is completely new to them. Also in most cases you can use an ability that's off with a penalty.

Next distribute Fate and Panache points. The default is 2 to Fate and 6 to Panache, but if a character is more of a magic user, they might prefer to move a point of Panache to Fate. Likewise, if the character is a brute, the player might want to signal this by moving a Fate point to Panache.

Finally, come up with two to three specialities. These are conditional statements that give the player a big advantage including spells or heroic abilities. Some are listed in the next chapter, but feel free to come up with some of your own. Naming them is also completely optional (but fun). The suitability of the specialities is always up to the GM.

#### Examples of Character Specialities

- **Wind Rider**: Spending one Fate point, you can call upon the wind to lift you up effectively teleporting you to anywhere you want to go.

- **Berserker**: If you are at 0 Panache, gain +1D to all physical rolls.

- **Most stylish in town**: When in high society (rich society), the TN of your social rolls is lowered by 1.

- **Poisoned right hand**: Lower your maximum Panache by one (forever) to receive a +1D to all rolls in this combat. Naturally your time is limited.

- **Healing magic**: Spend one Fate point and have someone recover two points of Panache.

- **Shapeshifting**: Spend one Fate point to take a form you know. This could give you an advantage in disguises, give you the ability to fly or even give you some temporary Panache.

**GM advice**: When in doubt, a good rule of the thumb is that a speciality should be cool. Spending a Fate point should be a bit stronger than automatically succeeding well in an ability roll.
