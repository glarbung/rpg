# Swish Swoosh

## Swashbuckling rules faster than a duel to the death or a doomed romance

### Purpose of These Rules

The purpose of this ruleset is to enable fast-paced storytelling with player agency while still leaving room for randomness and exciting reversals in fortune.

### Basic Rules

All dice are ten-sided (d10). Each die that is equal to or more than the treshold number (TN) is considered a success. Typically the TN for all rolls is 8, but more on that later.

Each die that shows a 10 explodes. It is counted as a success and a new die is rolled. The GM's dice do not explode. The PCs are the heroes after all.

Optional rule: if the player (again, not the GM) rolls more ones than half the number of dice rolled, the roll is automatically treated as a catastrophic failure. This might become tedious to track and might not fit the situation, so use it only to spice the game up if needed.

Each PC has between three to five abilities. These abilities have values between 2 and 6 (more on those later). When the character does something that involves danger or interesting consequences on failure, the player rolls the amount of dice designated by a suitable ability. Any amount of successess is a general success and extra ones can be used to add flare to the action (such as succeeding faster, quiter or while blowing a kiss to the handsome villain). No successess is a failure.

Sometimes a the players (and the GM) want to roll on things, but they feel that the situation isn't your standard situation. The following table gives examples of different modifiers that can be used. But remember, the characters are Heroes with a capital H. They should be able to be proficient in things they've never even heard of.

|The character ability seems off for the situation|-1 die|
|The character ability is clearly completely wrong for the situation|-2 dice|
|The character is well prepared or the situation is easy for a Hero|+1 die|
|The players want to roll on a task that is so easy it shouldn't be rolled on|+2 dice|
|The situation is extra difficult for a Hero|+1 to TN|
|The situation is extremely easy for a Hero|-1 to TN|

Multiple modifiers can of course stack, but the player never rolls less than 1 die or the TN never goes above 9.

If another character (PC or NPC) helps the character, give them +1 die of assistance (if a PC assist, they can roll their assistance die and describe the help they give). If a PC is helping in a task that fits their abilities, have the amount of dice be their ability divided by 2 (and rounded up) instead.
