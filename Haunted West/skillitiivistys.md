# Field of Study change
Allow included old skills, types and other personalizing stuff as long as it covers less than half all practical uses of the skill.
Can be taken at +5% for 2xp and cumulative as long as total level doesn't exceed 100%. If raising base skill would push specialized over 100%, refund accordingly.
At any time, one can increase the general skill without changing FoS total bonus by paying the dividence at 3xp per +5% (or 1xp if they have the maximum of two Fields of Study).
Character creation skill points can be used for Field of Studies, but they have the same 75% maximum limit as general skill rank.


# River test changes
Start each Bag of Nails with all characters' rivers at two points.
