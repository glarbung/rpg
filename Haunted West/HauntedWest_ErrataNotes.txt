Haunted West - things to addess in Errata:

-p. 38 (The River) states that Jacks can be flown for use "in other -trained- skills", which can be misleading as examples contradict interpretations that this refers to trained skills (like Medicine, not Long Arms) or the Trained*Talented skill rating level. If deemed useful, you could clarify that the limitation is to "known skills" instead, so no automatic successess in languages the character's never heard etc.

-p. 39 (Grit) states that "Burned Grit can be replaced if purchased with Experience (XP)", but there is no cost for replacing burned Grit on p. 312 (Myth-Making / XP Spends)

-p. 46 (Actions in Conflict) uses aiming as an exmple prompt action, but on p. 48 Aiming is listed under Partial Actions with confirmatory text of "...for each partial action dedicated to it".

-p. 61 (Example Rebuttals and Rebuffs) has Helena using Expression in a Social Duel, but it's not marked as a Social Duel skill anywhere else. It seems likely that Expression should be a Social Duel skill as it's also listed as valid for use on p. 62 (Calling em' out / Gunslinger Duels).

-p. 65 (Example Werewolf Terror Test) has the characters gaining a status condition from a Joker with the roll 77 over 40%. Since also the penalty stated at 5% differs from Pokerish -10% (p. 68), this seems like a mistake rather than a new rule where failed double digits on Terror tests would be considered Jokers.

-p. 122 (Step 9: Your Knowledge) lists additional 50 points to assign in Language and Culture. However, on p. 311 the number of assigned points for each is 70.

-p. 124 (Gumption (GUMP) & Initiative (INIT)) does not say that the Trait division is rounded down, though one can infer it should be from the fact that Initiative calculation is said to be rounded down on p. 46 (Initiative).

-p. 138 (5 - Shop Worker) lists +20% Apparel as an alternative for Long Arms in an isolated settlement. There is no other reference to an Apparel skill, but this could be meant as Scholar (Appraisal) instead.

-p. 138 (10 - Military Service) Skilled Soldier gives an extra Jack on successful calls, whereas all the other skilled apperenticeship bonused are stated to trigger on a related skill call with no mention of success. Certainly this doesn't mean that non-soldier apperentices can flow Jacks down the river on failed rolls, but it could be safer to clarify that all Apperentice Skilled bonuses grant an extra Jack on a call of the relevant skill only when successful.

-p. 144 (Paragon Archetypes) lists that each Paragon archetype would provide Propensities (2 Points), but p. 268 (Step 6: Propensities) contradicts this somewhat with one point plus zero, one or two additional points per level of gameplay: Westerner, Grittier or Spaghettier. It seems likely that Paragon Archetypes assumes the standard Westerner level of gameplay, in which case it could be worth mentioning there. Also the order of levels of gameplay might be wrong on p. 268, as it implies that Grittier - which provides the smallest amount of Trait points in Paragon creation - would provide more Propensity points than Westerner.

-p. 238 (The Resolute in the Old West) table has 13 entries for rolling on a d12. Likely the 7-8 entry should only be rolled on a 7 with the following entries moving down accordingly.

-p. 307 (The Code). We could not find mention of it, but assumed that Western Code starts at 10-10 for each pair on all characters, with modifications from Milestones before start of play. As it could also be free placement, this could be worth clarifying.

-p. 308 (The Code of the West Modifiers) likely has an error in some of the Jack modifier thresholds. Currently when pair values are either 7 & 13 or 5 & 15, one part of the pair gives a different Jack modifier than the other.

-p. 310 (Sample Bonding Posse Events) Roll 5 - Range War, if fought and rolled 3 gives the "Bounty Peculiarity (2 points)". No such peculiarity exists so this should likely be Among the Willows instead.
