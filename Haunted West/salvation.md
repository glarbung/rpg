## History

The Town of Salvation came into existence more out of chance than intent. It started as a small trading post owned by the Ortega family in the southern Jemez Mountains, that became a stop for fur trappers in the early 1810s. A few dozen trappers would meet there in the spring to drink, gamble, and spend half a year’s earnings before heading out again. The place quieted down until the next season, with occasional travelers stopping by for supplies. Over the following years, the trading post languished—but that changed with the winter of 1857. Winter was early and deadly, with trappers buried in snow for weeks, killing some. The survivors who made it to the trading post half-jokingly referred to the place as Salvation, and the name stuck. When it came time for the trappers to leave, some decided it might be time to settle down—and Salvation seemed like the perfect place. 

By this time, the founder’s granddaughter Mariana ran the place. The first new business in the town was a tannery, followed soon after by a smithy. Both supplied the goods to the trading post, and seeds of an independent economy sprouted. Others came to Salvation, some from Bleeding Kansas—tired of the fight between Abolitionists and Enslavers—who just wanted to live in peace; a Black family of escapees from enslavement; trappers who had married among the Indigenous people.

Salvation became known as a place of tolerance. Salvation’s growth eventually brought conflict, especially after the Civil War, with newcomers who fought on either side. Former Confederates included some from Nations that sided with the Confederacy, hoping that alliance would win them independence from a government that betrayed them at every turn; poor men from Ohio and West Virginia, kidnapped by Confederate raiders and forced into service, with no place they felt they could call home; and a few who fought for the Confederacy to prove their “superiority” over anyone who wasn’t white. The worst of this last group tended to meet with unfortunate circumstances, and that word got out. Salvation was a place for folks of that inclination to avoid. Union veterans were given cautious welcomes.

While violence is rare, there remains simmering resentment by some over the war, alongside the petty feelings people in small towns who know too much about their neighbor’s business have toward each other. Still, the general mindset of the people of Salvation remains tolerant. The resentments bubbling under Salvation’s surface tempted a wandering mind, however, and life there is about to get very interesting.

## Key People

**Julius Price**, a half-white, half-Chahta (Choctaw) man, is a former trapper who decided to settle down in Salvation after a near-fatal encounter with a grizzly. He functions as Salvation's official mayor when one is needed, but he would contend to stay home and nurse his aching bones and leave the leading to the town council.

**Rudolph Fisher**, Black historian, runs the town library. After escaping his Southern enslavers more than a decade ago, he found Salvation. Since then, he has collected troves of information about the town and region. He is always friendly, and carries a pistol for protection.

The Ortega Trading Coster is owned by **Mariana Ortega**, a Jemez community leader, who runs it with her partner Ana Sofia, a Jemez hunter. Ortega runs an honest business, and does her best to help the community and honor her forbearers.

**Camila Flores**, a Chahta (Choctaw) woman, runs the Old Post, a saloon/restaurant in the center of town. She knows everyone, and thinks she knows everything that is happening in Salvation.

**James York**, a Black Civil war veteran, is a relative newcomer who runs the livery and smithy after inheriting it from his aunt, who claimed to be descended from York who accompanied James Lewis.

**Tobias Benson** is a white pastor of Salvation’s church. He is a Quaker with an ecumencial view toward religion, and conducts open services.

**Janet Wainwright** is the white matron of a once-prominent South Carolina plantation-owning family, and is the outspoken advocate of the Confederate contingent in Salvation. She is adept at giving cutting insults disguised as flattery.

**Mateo Contreros**, a Mikasuki (Seminole) town leader, is head of the town council and descended from Salvation’s first families. He and Mariana Ortega are distant cousins through Mariana’s Jemez grandmother.

**Atsila Dawes**, Aniyunwiya (Cherokee) Lighthorse, is the charming local law enforcement. They begrudgingly carry a firearm when on duty, and try to eschew violence when possible. Dawes has elected three deputies from town who work in shifts.

**Louis 'Surgeon' McKenna** is an old, white hermit who lives on a big farm just outside of town. Not much is known about his past other than that he moved to Salvation just after the civil war and that he is a trained surgeon - a skill he is willing to share with the town on the condition that no one enters his plot of land.

**Leon 'Bull' Peters** is a young half-Mexican, half-white man who was found abandoned as a child in the wilderness near Salvation. While not the most intelligent individual, the whole town loves the jovial Bull who uses his physical strength to help around Salvation as much as he can for minimal pay.

**Beatrice Caldwell**, a white landowner who owns one of the biggest farms near Salvation. While not exactly a hermit, most leave her to her own devices. However, many consider her a distant godmother to the town.
